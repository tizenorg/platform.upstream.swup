Note: This is still under heavy development.

This plugin is used to generate update repos from OBS projects.
It uses patch files in YAML format to process requests and put
binary rpms into an existing repository.

Updates to the repo are incremental, that means multiple versions
of a package may exist.
The plugin also creates deltarpms using createrepo.

The plugin can be used with one of the examples as follows:

 osc updateinfo --patch kernel.yaml  --arch i586  --testing -d ./repo
