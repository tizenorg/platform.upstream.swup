updateinfo.py
---------------

This script creates the update file and the related metadata based
on an input file using the YAML syntax (compatible to MeeGo updates)

The input file has the following basic syntax:

--

Title: Tizen PC Update 2
Release: Tizen PC 3.0.0.2
Bugs:
    - 23504
    - 23652

    * Fix the capplet categories to it shows in the personal settings panel
Type: recommended
Status: stable
ID: TZPC-UP-0002-01

----

The input file has all the information related to the update which will be 
transferred to the update repository and then to the UI. The text format is 
simple markup language that will be converted to basic HTML.

To run this script you will need an update input file (the yaml file) and 
a directory named after the patch ID with the packages that need to be updated 
and using the following structure:

 TZPC-UP-0002-01/
    rpms  # packages that exist on the target but need updating
    new  # packages that are new and were not installed on the target system.

In addition, you will need a directory with the old packages that currently are 
installed on the system and that require tan update. This is needed to enable
delta package creation.

So, with those prequisites you should be able to call the the command:

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u TEXT, --updateinfo=TEXT
                        cached meta updateinfo file
  -U UPDATES, --updatesfile=UPDATES
                        master updates.xml file
  -O ORIGINAL, --original=ORIGINAL
                        Original and Old package directory
  -q, --quiet           do not show downloading progress
  -d DIR, --destdir=DIR
                        Directory where to store the updates.
  -p TEXT, --patch=TEXT
                        Patch information
  -P DIR, --patchdir=DIR
                        directory with patch files
  -t, --testing         test updates


python updateinfo.py --patch <path to patch>/TZPC-UP-0002-01.yaml \
    --original <path to old packages>/old_packages/  --destdir <destination>


<destination> which is set using --destdir has the update directory with the
packages inside. (TZPC-UP-0002-01/rpms and TZPC-UP-0002-01/new)
